<h2>Bridge with ROS</h2>

<h3>ROS messages to signals</h3>
Some entity and mecanisms allow you to exchange data from the ROS environment to the stack of tasks one, 
and convert ros messages in sot signals.
More details are provided <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_graph_bridge">on the ros wiki</a>

<h3>Executing python commands</h3>

<p>
The simplest solution consists in opening a remote interpreter in your terminal.
This provides the same output as the classical interpreter, but you will not have the autocompletion.
<code>rosservice call run_command</code>
</p>

<p>
If you run this command with an argument, you will only execute the command you provided, without opening the interpreter.
<code>rosservice call run_command  "print 'hello world'"</code>
</p>

<p> You can also execute a file, using this command
<code>rosrun dynamic_graph_bridge run_command '/absolute/path/to/file.py'</code>
</p>

<p>Note: The <code>run_command</code> service only considers the first line of your command, and does not accept end of line characters.
In other words, if you run this:
<code>rosservice call run_command "print 'a'\n print 'b'"</code><br/>
You'll have this result:<br/>
<pre><code>result: <NULL>
stdout: ''
stderr: SyntaxError: ('unexpected character after line continuation character', ('<string>', 1, 21, "print 'a'\\n print 'b'"))
</code></pre>

    But if you use this:
<code>rosservice call run_command "print 'a'; print 'b'"</code><br/>

You'll have the expected result:
<pre><code>result: None
stdout: a
b
</code></pre>
</p>
