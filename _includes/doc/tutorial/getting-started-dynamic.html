<h2>Kinematic robot simulations</h2>

<p>
  We assume that (1) the stack of tasks has been installed using the installation instruction provided
  <a href="https://github.com/Stack-Of-Tasks/sot-doc/wiki/Installation">there</a> and (2) that you understood the stack of tasks mecanism.
</p>

In this section are detailed some examples to test the stack of tasks framework 
on the humanoid robot <a href="">Romeo</a>.   


To vizualize the robot, you can use <code>rviz</code>.


<h3>Running the python scripts</h3>

To execute the scripts and display the results with rviz, you need 2 consoles.</br>

In the first, start the viewer.
<pre><code>$ roslaunch romeo_description sot_display.launch</code></pre>
Note: if you do not want to use the viewer, you can only start <code>roscore</code>.</br>

In the second, start the python script.   
<pre><code class="bash">$ ipython -i kine_romeo.py</code></pre>

<h3>Detail of the python scripts</h3>

<p>
  Those scripts are located in <code>${your_installation_path}/lib/python2.X/site-packages/dynamic_graph/tutorial.</code>
  With the installation script, the installation path is <code>${HOME}/devel/INSTALLATION_FOLDER/install</code>,
  where <code>INSTALLATION_FOLDER</code> is the folder specified in the istallation.

  python2.X is your version of python version: 2.6 or 2.7
</p>

To run them, it is necessary to complete the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH.
To this purpose, you can either
<ol>
  <li> source the file <code>config_XXX.bash</code> created during the compilation using the install-sot.sh script.
    This file is located in the same folder as install_sot.sh.
  </li>
  <li>
    or you can do it manually:
    <pre><code class="bash">export your_installation_path=${HOME}/devel/INSTALLATION_FOLDER/install
	export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${your_installation_path}/../:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH;
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${your_installation_path}/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${your_installation_path}/lib/plugin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
	export PYTHONPATH=${your_installation_path}/lib/python2.X/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>






<pre><code class="python">
# Create the robot

from dynamic_graph.sot.core.robot_simu import RobotSimu

robot.tasks['left-ankle'].controlGain.value = 200

solver.push(robot.tasks['left-wrist'])
#robot.featureCom.selec.value = '011'
#poserpy = PoseRollPitchYawToMatrixHomo ('poserpy')
#poserpy.sin.value = (0.08, 0.4, 0.0, 0,0,0)
#plug(poserpy.sout, robot.features['left-wrist'].reference)
</code></pre>

This code can be split in 3 parts.



<h4>Part 1: creation of the robot</h4>
<pre><code class="python">
# Create the robot
from dynamic_graph.sot.romeo.robot import *
from dynamic_graph.sot.core.robot_simu import RobotSimu
robot = Robot('romeo', device=RobotSimu('romeo'))

# Binds with ros, export joint_state.
from dynamic_graph.ros import *
ros = Ros(robot)

# Create a solver.
from dynamic_graph.sot.application.velocity.precomputed_tasks import initialize
solver = initialize ( robot)

</code></pre>

<p>

</p>



<h4>Part 2: realizing a virtual loop</h4>
<pre><code class="python">
# Part 2: realizing a virtual loop
from dynamic_graph.sot.core.utils.thread_interruptible_loop import loopInThread,loopShortcuts
dt=5e-3
@loopInThread
def inc():
    robot.device.increment(dt)

runner=inc()
[go,stop,next,n]=loopShortcuts(runner)

go()
</code></pre>

<p>
When the controller is not embedded (see <a href="TODO">TODO</a> for more details), it is necessary
to trigger regularly the recomputation of the dynamic graph.
This is realized here by the line <code>robot.device.increment(dt)</code> that increments its time value
and realizes the kinematic integration of the control law.
</p>

<p>
Four methods control this loop:
<ul>
<li><code>go</code> starts the loop</li>
<li><code>stop</code> stops the loop</li>
<li><code>next</code> </li>
<li><code>n </code></li>
</ul>
</p>



<h4>Part 3: specify the task</h4>

<p>
At this point of the code, the simulation is already running, but the robot
is still. It is controlled by 3 tasks:

<pre><code class="python">print solver
+-----------------
+   SOT     
+-----------------
| romeo_task_com
| romeo_task_left-ankle
| romeo_task_right-ankle
+-----------------
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>romeo_task_com, A task controlling the center of mass</li>
  <li>A 6d position task for the left ankle</li>
  <li>A 6d position task for the right ankle</li>
</ul>
</p>

Those three tasks are part of the set of tasks predefined (but not added to the stack) in the dictionary of tasks provided by the entity _Robot_.  
The dictionary can be consulted using the command: <code>robot.tasks</code>
All of those tasks are 6d tasks.

<pre><code class="python">In [1]: robot.tasks
Out[1]: 
{'balance': Task romeo_task_balance: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_com
-> romeo_feature_left-ankle
-> romeo_feature_right-ankle
,
 'chest': Task romeo_task_chest: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_chest
,
 'com': Task romeo_task_com: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_com
,
 'gaze': Task romeo_task_gaze: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_gaze
,
 'left-ankle': Task romeo_task_left-ankle: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_left-ankle
,
 'left-wrist': Task romeo_task_left-wrist: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_left-wrist
,
 'right-ankle': Task romeo_task_right-ankle: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_right-ankle
,
 'right-wrist': Task romeo_task_right-wrist: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_right-wrist
,
 'waist': Task romeo_task_waist: 
--- LIST ---  
-> romeo_feature_waist
}
</code></pre>


Let's now add a task for the left wrist and define its objective.
As a 6d task, it is possible to define the objective by providing directly the homogeneous matrix. To simplify its definition, we are going to use an entity that converts 6d vectors (x,y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) into homogeneous matrices:
<pre><code class="python">poserpy = PoseRollPitchYawToMatrixHomo ('poserpy')
poserpy.sin.value = (0.08, 0.4, 0.0, 0,0,0)
plug(poserpy.sout, robot.features['left-wrist'].reference)
solver.push(robot.tasks['left-wrist'])</code></pre>



<p> In the script, only the position of the hand is controlled. To change the degrees of freedom controlled, change the value of the signal selec.
  This signal is a sequence of boolean in <b>reverse polish notation</b>: psi, theta, phi, z, y, x. For example:
</p>

<pre><code class="python">robot.features['left-wrist'].reference.selec.value = '111111' # The task is controlled in position and orientation.
    taskRH.feature.selec.value = '000111' # The task is then controlled in position only
</code></pre>



<p>
  This task is characterized by 4 entities: the task, the operational point (here the right hand augmented by a translation), the desired position for the hand (here only 3d are defined) and the gain of the task (an adaptive gain).   
  All those elements are gathered in a structure called _taskRH_,instance of _MetaTask6d_, that realizes all the links between the several entities.  
</p>


<p>
  The definition of this task does not use the predefined version of the task contained in the dictionary, only to present an example of task creation.

  Typing <code>go</code>starts a the simulation loop.
  The robot will then go to the desired positions defined by the tasks. 
  You can change interactively the content of the stack, the hand... using the python interface.
</p>

<p>
  To continue the example, you can for example try adding a task on the left hand, following the same scheme as for the right hand.
</p>

<h2>walk_romeo.py</h2>

In this example, the Romeo robot goes for a (kinematic) walk.
This script uses the jrl-walkgen package to compute the required postures for the feet, the center of mass and the waist orientation.

The script is built in the same way than the kinematic example (Creation of the solver, definition of the *incrementation* loop), 
and definition of the pattern generator elements:
<pre><code class="python">
from dynamic_graph.sot.pattern_generator.walking import CreateEverythingForPG , walkFewSteps, walkAndrei
CreateEverythingForPG ( robot , solver )
# walkFewSteps ( robot )
walkAndrei( robot )
robot.pg.velocitydes.value =(0.1,0.0,0.0)
</code></pre>




The stack contains the following tasks (by order of decreasing priority)
<ol>
  <li> ROMEO_task_com, that forces the Center of mass of the robot to be in the support polygon (only the x and y axes are constrained). You can access it using <code>robot.tasks['com']</code>.</li>
  <li> taskWaist, that constrains the rotation and translation of the waist in a plane. You can access it using <code>robot.tasks['waist']</code>.</li>
  <li> ROMEO_task_right-ankle, that defines the 6 dof position of the right Foot</li>
  <li> ROMEO_task_left-ankle, that defines the 6 dof position of the left Foot</li>
</ol>



In addition to those tasks (that translate the output of the pattern generator into tasks), another task is defined: <code>robot.tasks['robot_task_position']</code>, to force the arms, head and chest to stay still during the walk
<p>
  You can control the walk of the robot with the following command:
  <code>robot.pg.velocitydes.value = (x, y, theta)</code>
  <ol>
    <li> x is the forward/backward velocity</li>
    <li> y is the lateral velocity</li>
    <li> theta is the rotation velocity (requires that ||(x,y)|| > 0.000  1)</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>sot-concept.py: understanding the stack of task mechanism</h3>


This script aims at understanding the mechanisms of a hierarchy of task.

<p>In this script, the robot Romeo has to grasp a ball. 
  Several sets of stack are tested in order to exemplify the influence and necessity of elements/tasks 
  such as com control, joint limits, damping... during the realization of a simple motion.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of this script is to see by the example the possible faulty behaviors that 
  can appear (divergence, loss of stability ...) when the stack is incomplete.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Only the task RH</br>
    Since there is no constraint on the feet, the robot flies to the objective
  </li>

  <li> Task RH + foot constraint, balance is kept</br>
    The robot put its hand at the desired place while keeping its feet on the ground
  </li>

  <li> Task RH + foot constraint, balance is lost</br>   
    The robot put its hand at the desired place while keeping its feet on the ground, but the balance of the robot is lost due to the desired position of the hand
  </li>

  <li> Task RH + foot constraint + COM=</br>
    The robot put its hand at the desired place while keeping its feet on the ground and its balance, but enters in self collision during its motion
  </li>

  <li> Task RH + foot constraint + COM= + JL</br>
    The self collision is solved by adding a artificial joint limit.
  </li>

  <li> Task RH + foot constraint + COM<   </li>


					  <li> Task RH + foot constraint + COM= + SINGULARITY</br>
					    The robot put its hand at the desired place. 
					    Due to the motion of the ball (type <code>i</code> to move it), the robot goes into a near singular configuration and the control law reaches high values, causing a strange behavior of the robot.
					  </li>

  <li>Task RH + foot constraint + COM= + SINGULARITE + DAMPING</br>
    In this case, some damping is added to prevent high control values.
  </li>
</ol>
Note: you can change the configuration by re-typing <code>menu()</code>
