<h3>dynamic-graph 101</h3>

This first tutorial focuses on the dynamic-graph mecanism, which is the backbone of the stack of tasks framework.
This tutorial details ...

<p>
  As a toy example, let's realize this operation <code class="python">res=(a+b) * (c+d)</code> using dynamic-graph elements.
  The corresponding code would be this:
</p>

<pre><code class="python">from dynamic_graph import plug
from dynamic_graph.sot.core.operator import Add_of_double
from dynamic_graph.sot.core.operator import Multiply_of_double
a=1
b=2
c=3
d=4

# Crate  the entities
ad1  = Add_of_double('ad1')
ad2  = Add_of_double('ad2')
mult = Multiply_of_double('mult')

# Fix the values of the input for the first operation
ad1.sin1.value = a
ad1.sin2.value = b

# Fix the values of the input for the second operation
ad2.sin1.value = c
ad2.sin2.value = d

# plug all the signals
plug(ad1.sout, mult.sin1)
plug(ad2.sout, mult.sin2)
</code></pre>

In order to obtain the result of the multiplication, let's do:
<pre><code class="python">mult.sout.value
#> 0</code></pre>

This is normal.
At the creation of an entity, each of the signals has a default value associated to the time 0.
In order to have the new value, it is necessary to increment the time, so as to trigger the recomputation.
<pre><code class="python">mult.sout.time
#> 0
mult.sout.recompute(1)
mult.sout.value
#> 21</code></pre>

Let's now change one of the inputs of the entity ad1.
<pre><code class="python">ad1.sin1.value = 0</code></pre>

The result becomes:
<pre><code class="python">mult.sout.recompute(2)
mult.sout.value
#> 14</code></pre>

Note that the intermediary signal ad1.sout, has been updated, while ad2.sout hasn't:
<pre><code class="python">ad1.sout.time
#> 2
ad2.sout.time
#> 1</code></pre>


<h3>Entity manipulation</h3>

<h2>Examples</a></h2>

<p>
  In the proposed examples, the entity graph is created in a terminal python interpreter and the simulation loop is run within this terminal.
