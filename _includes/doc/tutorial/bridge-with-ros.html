<p>
The core of the stack of tasks mechanism is independent from ROS: an execution is hence realized in a closed environment
(the entities are only defined in the python environment and are only accessible via python commands).
However, some bridges with ROS exist for the display, but also to send and receive some pieces of data.
</p>


<h2>ROS messages to signals</h2>
Two entities allow you to exchange data from the ROS environment to the stack of tasks one, 
and convert ros messages in sot signals, namely <code>rosPublish</code> and <code>rosSubscribe</code>.

Here is a example of publication of matrix homogeneous from the sot environment to the sot environment:
<pre><code class="python">
ros.rosPublish.add('matrixHomoStamped', robot.frames['rightGripper'].name +'.position', 'right_gripper')
ros.rosPublish.displaySignals()
--- <rosPublish> signal list: 
    |-- <Sig:N12dynamicgraph10RosPublishE(rosPublish)::input(MatrixHomo)::romeo_rightHand.position (Type Cst) AUTOPLUGGED
    `-- <Sig:N12dynamicgraph10RosPublishE(rosPublish)::input(int)::trigger (Type Fun)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">
rostopic list 
/right_gripper  
</code></pre>

<p>
This creates an input signal for the ros.rosPublish entity, as well as the rostopic element ""
In order to publish something, it is hence necessary to plug the something

<h2>Executing python commands</h2>

<p>
  The simplest solution consists in opening a remote interpreter in your terminal.
  This provides the same output as the classical interpreter, but you will not have the autocompletion.
  <code>rosservice call run_command</code>
</p>

<p>
  If you run this command with an argument, you will only execute the command you provided, without opening the interpreter.
  <code>rosservice call run_command  "print 'hello world'"</code>
</p>

<p> You can also execute a file, using this command
  <code>rosrun dynamic_graph_bridge run_command '/absolute/path/to/file.py'</code>
</p>

<p>Note: The <code>run_command</code> service only considers the first line of your command, and does not accept end of line characters.
  In other words, if you run this:
  <code>rosservice call run_command "print 'a'\n print 'b'"</code><br/>
  You'll have this result:<br/>
  <pre><code>result: <NULL>
	stdout: ''
	stderr: SyntaxError: ('unexpected character after line continuation character', ('<string>', 1, 21, "print 'a'\\n print 'b'"))
  </code></pre>

  But if you use this:
  <code>rosservice call run_command "print 'a'; print 'b'"</code><br/>

  You'll have the expected result:
  <pre><code>result: None
      stdout: a
      b
  </code></pre>
</p>
